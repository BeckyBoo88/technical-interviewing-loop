There are three types of edits that can be performed on a strings as mentioned below.

1. Insert a character.
2. Remove a character.
3. Replace a character.

Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

pales, pale -> true
pale, bale -> true
pale, bake -> false

You can solve this problem in whichever language you would like. However, you must first solve purely in pseudocode, and then in the language of your choice. For this problem, feel free to solve in small teams outloud, or on your own. 

To submit add two files to this folder: `pseudo.language_of_your_choice` with just your pseudo code, and `solution.language_of_your_choice` with your implemented solution.
